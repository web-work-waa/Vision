        The robot Ultron is the creator of Vision, a type 
        of android he calls a "synthezoid", for use against 
        Ultron's own creator, Dr. Hank Pym (Ant-Man/Giant 
        Man/Goliath/Yellowjacket) and Pym's wife, Janet van 
        Dyne (the Wasp) of the superhero team the Avengers. 
        Ultron sends his new servant to lead the Avengers 
        into a trap. Wasp is the first to encounter the synthezoid, 
        and describes it as a "vision" while trying to escape. Adopting the name, 
        Vision is convinced by the Avengers to turn against Ultron.

        [6] After learning how 
        Ultron created him, using the brain patterns of then-deceased Simon Williams (Wonder Man), 
        Vision becomes a member of the team.[7] The team initially believes the Vision's body was 
        created from that of the android original Human Torch.[8] The Avengers later are told that the 
        time lord Immortus used the power of the Forever Crystal to split the original Human Torch 
        into two entities â€“ one body remained the original Torch while Ultron rebuilt the other
         as the Vision. This was part of his plan to nurture a relationship for the Scarlet Witch 
         that would prevent her from having any children, as her power level meant that any offspring 
         she might have could threaten 
        the cosmic beings of the Marvel Universe.[9]

        Not long after joining the team, Vision is temporarily controlled by Ultron, and rebuilds Ultron out of adamantium, battling the Avengers before regaining control of himself.[10] Shortly after that, the Vision first meets Wanda Maximoff, the mutant Scarlet Witch,[11] with whom he later becomes romantically involved.[12] The two eventually marry and, via the Scarlet Witch's hex powers, they have twin boys named Thomas and William.[13]
